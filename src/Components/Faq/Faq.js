                We understand that you may not have a printer handy when youâ€™re
                traveling so it is not necessary to have a printed copy.
                However, we require that you show ID matching your reservation
                and also the Order # that is immediately emailed to you after
                you make your reservation.

                Are there any particular Dress Code ?

              <Accordion.Body>
                Wear whatever is comfortable. It is recommended to have a sturdy
                pair of broken-in trail shoes, boots, or sneakers. It is
                preferable to dress in layers and wear clothing that will wick
                away perspiration and keep you dry and comfortable
